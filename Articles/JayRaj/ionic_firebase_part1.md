# Creating a Bucket List Application with the Ionic Framework

'Bucket lists' (a list of things to experience before death) have always been a popular list for people to maintain.

In Part One of this tutorial, we'll create the basis for a simple Bucket List application using the IONIC framework. This will create a home page that enables users to sign up to the Bucket list app and sign in. We'll use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a back end for our Bucket List application.

[IONIC](http://ionicframework.com/) is a HTML5 mobile application development framework which helps developers build native looking apps. It is mainly focused on creating an attractive UI using web technologies such as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It requires AngularJS to drive it's many features like gestures and animations.

Part two will show how to create a platform for a wish list in the Bucket list app.

Source code from this tutorial is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/iBucketListApp_Part1).

## Getting Started
Start by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it already, also install the node package manager _npm_.

Use npm to install IONIC.

```
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

We'll be creating the app for the Android platform. So, make sure you have the required platform dependencies installed.

Once the installation is complete, create an IONIC project.

```
ionic start iBucketApp blank
```

The above command creates a blank IONIC project. Navigate to the project directory _iBucketApp_, add the required platform, build and emulate.

```
cd iBucketApp
ionic platform add android
ionic build android
ionic emulate android
```

If all goes well, you should be able to see the blank app running in the android emulator.

## Project Structure
If you look at the project structure, you can see that inside the project directory _iBucketApp_, there is a folder called _www_, this is the folder where we'll be working.

![Project Folder Structure](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q1VqhhdnnqA/VSkVZcmj1QI/AAAAAAAABDU/MFrqRy0hscU/w756-h567-no/8d8j8d8u.png)

Inside _www/js_ is a file called _app.js_ which is the root file of our app. We'll define our application routes inside _app.js_. Inside _index.html_, we'll define the `ion-nav-view` where we'll render different templates.

Making edits and running the app on the emulator is a time consuming task. So we'll use the browser to test our app and when it's ready we'll try it on the android emulator. To make it work with the browser we'll need to install the required _package.json_ dependencies using `npm`. Inside the iBucketApp directory, run the following command to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

IONIC provides command line utilities to make app development and testing easier. Once such command is `ionic serve`. Once dependencies are installed, run `ionic serve` and you should able to view the app in the web browser.

## Creating the Home Screen
Let's start by creating a home page for the iBucketList app. Inside the _www_ directory create a folder called _templates_. Create a file called _home.html_.

We'll be switching our view as per the url requested. So we'll make use of the IONIC directive API [ion-nav-view](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionNavView/).

Remove all the code inside the _index.html_ `body` tag. Add the `ion-nav-view` directive to the body of _index.html_.

```html
<body ng-app="starter">
  <ion-nav-view></ion-nav-view>
</body>
```

As per the url requested, we'll render different views inside the `ion-nav-view` in _index.html_. The [ion-view](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionView/) directive is another IONIC directive API which is the child of `ion-nav-view`.  It's a container which holds the view content. Open _templates/home.html_ and add a ion-view with a header tag.

```html
<ion-view>
     <h1>This is Home Template</h1>
</ion-view>
```

The template and containers are ready. Now we need to define the routes and their respective views. We'll make use of [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). Open _js/app.js_ and define the `home` state.

```javascript
.config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $stateProvider
        .state('home', {
            url: '/home',
            templateUrl: 'templates/home.html',
            controller: 'HomeCtrl'
        })

    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/home');
});

```

In the above code, we have defined the template and controller for the url `/home`. We have also set the default url to `/home`.

Create a file called _js/controller.js_ and define the `HomeCtrl` inside it.

```javascript
angular.module('starter.controllers', [])

.controller('HomeCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {

}]);
```

Include the _js/controller.js_ file in _index.html_.

```
<script src="js/controller.js"></script>
```

Inject `starter.controllers` into the starter app in _app.js_.

```
angular.module('starter', ['ionic','starter.controllers'])
```

Save the above changes and you should be able to see the changes in the browser.

![Home Page View](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--epzSKEdPOU/VSkgLJlzWTI/AAAAAAAABEA/RgUbcMOmrbk/w698-h567-no/lapslas9a8s.png)

Next, let's modify the _home.html_ template. We'll start by adding a header to our app. Adding a header requires us to add the `ion-nav-bar` to the _index.html_ page. Add this code above the `ion-nav-view` tag.

```
<ion-nav-bar class="bar-positive">
</ion-nav-bar>
```

The title of the `ion-view` passed will display in the header in `ion-nav-bar`. In _home.html_ add the title attribute to `ion-view`.

Let's add a few elements for the user to sign in. We'll start by adding the [ion-content](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionContent/) to _home.html_. Inside `ion-content` we'll create input boxes and buttons. Here is the resulting code in _home.html_ (Replace the current contents):

```
<ion-view title="iBucketList">
    <ion-content>
        <div class="list list-inset">
            <label class="item item-input">
                <input type="text" placeholder="Username">
            </label>
            <label class="item item-input">
                <input type="password" placeholder="password">
            </label>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="button button-block button-assertive">
                Sign In
            </button>
        </div>

    </ion-content>
</ion-view>
```

Save the changes and you should be able to view the sign in form on the home page.

![Sign In Form in Home Page](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uVotiEOZ4cE/VSkkAY9sa7I/AAAAAAAABEc/aijXW5pe5OA/w700-h500-no/77ys7syd7sd.png)

The Sign In button is stretched. Let's add some padding to it's container.

Inside css/style.css, add:

```
.padding {
	padding: 10px;
}
```

Apply the `padding` style to the button parent div.

```
<div class="padding">
    <button class="button button-block button-assertive">
        Sign In
    </button>
</div>
```

Save the changes and you should be able view the new sign in form.

## Implementing Sign In Functionality
We'll be using Firebase as the back end for our Bucket list app. Register on [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) if you don't have an account already. Once registered you should have your own Firebase URL. For examples, here is my firebase URL:

```
https://burning-fire-1723.firebaseio.com
```https://bucketlistsp.firebaseio.com/

In order to use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), we need to include the following script references in _index.html_.

```
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.0.4/firebase.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/angularfire/0.9.0/angularfire.min.js"></script>
```

Once the references have been added, inject the `Firebase` module into the application. Modify _controller.js_ to inject the Firebase module:

```
angular.module('starter.controllers', ['firebase'])
```

Inject `$firebaseAuth` into the `HomeCtrl`.

```
.controller('HomeCtrl',['$scope','$firebaseAuth', function($scope,$firebaseAuth)
```

Next in the _home.html_ page, add the `ng-model` directive to the username and password input elements.

```
<label class="item item-input">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Username" ng-model="login.username">
</label>
<label class="item item-input">
    <input type="password" placeholder="password" ng-model="login.password">
</label>
```

Add the [ngClick](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClick) directive to the sign in button.

```
<button ng-click="signin()"  class="button button-block button-assertive">
  				Sign In
</button>
```

In `HomeCtrl`, define a function called `signin` which will be invoked when the user clicks the Sign In button.

```
$scope.login={};

$scope.signin = function() {
    var username = $scope.login.username;
    var password = $scope.login.password;

    console.log(username, password);
}
```

Save the changes and try to sign in after entering the username and password. If all goes well you should be able to see the username and password in the browser console.

Next, we'll try to authenticate against a user in Firebase. In order to make this work, first we'll create a `Firebase` object using the Firebase URL. Add the following into the function we just created, just after '$scope.login={}'.

```
var firebaseObj = new Firebase("https://burning-fire-1723.firebaseio.com");
```

Using the `firebaseObj` we'll create a `loginObj`.

```
var loginObj = $firebaseAuth(firebaseObj);
```

Now when the user clicks the Sign In button, we'll use the [$authWithPassword](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/api.html#angularfire-users-and-authentication-authwithpasswordcredentials-options) API to authenticate against Firebase.

```
loginObj.$authWithPassword({
        email: username,
        password: password
    })
    .then(function(user) {
        //Success callback
        console.log('Authentication successful');

    }, function(error) {
        //Failure callback
        console.log('Authentication failure');
    });
```

Here is the modified `HomeCtrl` code:

```
.controller('HomeCtrl', ['$scope', '$firebaseAuth', function($scope, $firebaseAuth) {

    $scope.login = {};
    var firebaseObj = new Firebase("https://burning-fire-1723.firebaseio.com");
    var loginObj = $firebaseAuth(firebaseObj);

    $scope.signin = function() {
        var username = $scope.login.username;
        var password = $scope.login.password;

        loginObj.$authWithPassword({
                email: username,
                password: password
            })
            .then(function(user) {
                //Success callback
                console.log('Authentication successful');

            }, function(error) {
                //Failure callback
                console.log('Authentication failure');
            });

    }
}]);
```

Save the above changes and try to sign in using username, _sam@sam.com_ and password _sam_. On successful authentication you should have a success message in your browser console.

Let's create a user home page to redirect the user once successfully authenticated. In the templates folder add a page called `userHome.html`. Here is the code for `userHome.html`:

```
<ion-view title="iBucketList">
     <ion-content>
     <div class="userHomeMsg">
        <span>
        	<h2>Succesfully Logged in !!</h2>
        </span>
      </div>
    </ion-content>
</ion-view>
```

Add a new state called `userHome` for the _userHome.html_ page in _app.js_.

```
.state('userHome', {
    url:'/userHome',
    templateUrl:'templates/userHome.html',
    controller:'UserHomeCtrl'
  })

```

Create the controller `UserHomeCtrl` inside the _controller.js_ file.

```
.controller('UserHomeCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope){

}])

```

Now on successful authentication, we'll redirect the user to the user home page. Inject `$state` into `HomeCtrl`.

```
.controller('HomeCtrl',['$scope','$firebaseAuth','$state', function($scope,$firebaseAuth,$state)
```

On the success callback of the `$authWithPassword` API call, redirect to the `userHome` state, replace the current sign in function with the following:

```
loginObj.$authWithPassword({
        email: username,
        password: password
    })
    .then(function(user) {
        //Success callback
        console.log('Authentication successful');
        $state.go('userHome');

    }, function(error) {
        //Failure callback
        console.log('Authentication failure');
    });
```

Save the changes and try to sign in using username `sam@sam.com` and password `sam`. On successful authentication you will be redirected to the user home page.

## Wrapping Up
In this tutorial, we learnt how to get started with creating a simple Bucket List app using the IONIC framework and Firebase, developing the sign in and sign up forms and user home page.

In the next part of this tutorial, we'll implement the sign up functionality for the bucket list app. Please let me know your thoughts, suggestions or any corrections in the comments below.
